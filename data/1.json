But it's quite different.  In fact, if you don't understand the new features, when you look at JavaScript written using ES6, you're going to struggle.</p><p>The goal of this primer is to get you up and running with ES6 right away.  ES6 has a lot of new features, but for this primer I'm only going to cover the most important ones.  Just enough so that you'll know what you're doing. I'll also sprinkle around some links to help you dive into the details where you want to.  </p><p>I'm heavily indebted to MDN and Luke Hoban for these examples.
